# hello-world
Hi All!

I am Yerandy and I love how technology is changing the wold. I just not love the advancement of technology, but I want to be part of it. While I'm still figuring it out how I can add value to this new era, I am learning as much as I can about progamming languages, modeling methods, and what is going on in the world.
